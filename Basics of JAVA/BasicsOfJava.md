# Basics of Java

## Variables
> A variable is a memory location used to store data values, and is being referenced by a variable name in programming.

### Declaration of a variable in Java
> Declaration of a variable in Java means that we are instructing the Java Compiler to assign a memory location, which is later being referenced in the program.
#### Syntax
`dataType variableName;`
#### Example
`int age;`

### Initialization of a variable in Java
> Initialization of a variable in Java means that we are assigning an initial value to the variable that we had declared earlier.
#### Syntax
`variableName = value;`
#### Example
`age = 20;`
